Partitioning quality : edgecut = 899
-> It is roughly the total number of edges (faces) which will be shared by the processors.
-> The lesser this number is, the lesser the total volume of communication between processors.
-> You can increase nb_essais option (default 1) to try to reduce (but at a higher CPU cost) this number.
