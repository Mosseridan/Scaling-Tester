Decouper : Splitting of a domain
 Domain name to split : dom_solide
==============================================
The extreme coordinates of the domain dom_solide are:
x is between -0.004 and 0.004
y is between -0.004 and 0.004
z is between -0.0001 and 0
==============================================
==============================================
The volume cells of the domain dom_solide are:
sum(volume cells)= 6.4e-09
mean(volume cells)= 1e-12
min(volume cells)= 1e-12
max(volume cells)= 1e-12
==============================================
domaine = dom_solide

Partitioning quality : edgecut = 1098
-> It is roughly the total number of edges (faces) which will be shared by the processors.
-> The lesser this number is, the lesser the total volume of communication between processors.
-> You can increase nb_essais option (default 1) to try to reduce (but at a higher CPU cost) this number.
